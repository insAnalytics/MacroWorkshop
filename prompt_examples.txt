Prompt engineering is the structured design of instructions given to AI systems.
Clear prompts define the role, task, context, constraints, and output format.
For example, the AI can be instructed to act as a refinery operations analyst summarizing daily KPI deviations.
Proper prompting improves accuracy and reduces ambiguity in regulated environments.

"Role: Act as a Senior Refinery Operations Analyst.
Task: Summarize the daily KPI deviations based on the attached sensor log.
Context: We are preparing for a morning shift-handover meeting. Focus specifically on any fluctuations in pressure or temperature that exceeded the 5% safety threshold in the distillation unit.
Constraints: Maintain a neutral, technical tone. Ensure all data points comply with OSHA reporting standards. Do not speculate on root causes unless supported by the log data.
Output Format: Provide a bulleted list of deviations followed by a 2-sentence 'Action Required' summary."

This is a test change.
